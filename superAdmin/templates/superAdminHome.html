        <p>Introduction
Motor vehicles are required to be registered to establish and maintain a record of the corresponding owner and usually tracked by the Road Transport Authority (RTA) in Bangladesh. Usually, there are a number of RTA branches across the country, and the government provides services for vehicle registration by filling out a typical form with identification information required from the owner. The information is used for vehicle authentication, ownership verification, and while changing the ownership. However, the current motor vehicle registration process, the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) stores all the registration-related information of a motor vehicle in a central database. Centralized systems have severe security issues, and with the growth of cyber-attacks around the world, single-point failure of a compromised system can lead to a tremendous loss. Besides, the registration takes a long time with a human-involved record entry process and attracts corrupted third parties (e.g., brokers) to intervene.
